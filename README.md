Surfing on nothing
------------------

> It's actually referring to something much more existential,
> it's just surfing on nothing.
> Being lost in your head or in your imagination but you know,
> whenever I listen to music I always find myself off somewhere.
> Somewhere in space. You know,
> in mental space and it's a reference to that.  
> ― [Matthew Caws, lead singer of the band Nada Surf][ABOUT_NADA_SURF]

FIRST STEPS
-----------

Each function is defined in a separate file, without a module namespace.
To avoid cluttering the global namespace in the browser, you can wrap
these functions in a closure of your choice.

Besides native objects and methods, these functions depend exclusively
on functions defined in [project nada][NADA]; these dependencies are
listed in a comment at the start of each file.

Look at unit tests for an example of use; you can find the documentation
of each function in its source code.
